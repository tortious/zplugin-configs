# zinit-configs

<h2>Pull-requests welcomed!</h2>

Feel free to submit your zshrc if it contains `zinit` commands.

# Searching the repository

Use the Github search interface – just enter a query e.g. "trapd00r/LS_COLORS"
like in the picture below, to find zshrc with references to this plugin, and
ensure that you activate the "*in this repository*" variant of the search:

![Starting search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/zinit-configs/img/srch.png)

Then, results should appear like below:

## OR ...

just clone the repository and issue `ack`, `ag` or `grep` command :)

# Submitting zshrc

You can either:

 - open a PR – fastest method
 - submit an issue with URL to the zshrc (or with the zshrc pasted) – [a quick
   link](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit-configs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=request-to-add-zshrc-to-the-zinit-configs-repo.md)

# The repository structure

The structure of the repository is very simple: in its main directory there are
directories located, named after the user-names of the submitting users. In
those directories there are the zshrc files that the user decided to share.

# Try configurations with docker

## Requirements

You should have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and `zsh` installed
to use this functionality. Check you have them present on your system:

```sh
docker version
zsh --version
```

The other dependency is interactive filter. You should have either
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or
[fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) in your `$PATH`. You might choose to
install any of them via zinit:

```sh
# Install fzf
zinit ice from"gh-r" as"command"
zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
# or fzy
zinit ice as"command" make"\!PREFIX=$ZPFX install" \
    atclone"cp contrib/fzy-* $ZPFX/bin/" \
    pick"$ZPFX/bin/fzy*"
zinit load jhawthorn/fzy
```

Keep in mind you will need a few Gb of free space to store docker images.

## Running a configuration

To try a configuration, you have to clone this repository and execute a `run.sh`
script:

```sh
# Clone repository with configurations
git clone 'https://github.com/zdharma/zinit-configs'
# Run the configuration picker
./zinit-configs/run.sh
```

… or you can install this repository as a `zsh` plugin!

```sh
# Then, install this repo
zinit load zdharma/zinit-configs
# Run the command
zinit-configs
```

Now you will have to wait for a few minutes, while the required environment is
being installed into the docker image. The next time you will want to try
a configuration, loading it will take less time.
